**[Aspects](https://github.com/steipete/Aspects)** | Think of Aspects as method swizzling on steroids. It allows you to add code to existing methods per class or per instance, whilst thinking of the insertion point e.g. before/instead/after. Aspects automatically deals with calling super and is easier to use than regular method
**[JavaScriptBridge](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/JavaScriptBridge)** | Make using `JavascriptCore` framework ( iOS 7 SDK ) easier
**[MCSCollectionUtility](https://github.com/macoscope/MCSCollectionUtility)** | `Categories` for NSArray, NSSet and NSDictionary which provide many methods which make operations on collection easier and cleaner
